# n-dimensional-trapezium-rule
Code that takes an n-variable function and calculates definite n-dimensional integrals using the trapezium rule

The program makes use of Sympy, and the time taken to execute goes as the power n. The output can either be in exact Sympy-output form, or evaluated to decimal form.

The program is currently geared up for a specific function (Maxwellian) - this will be cleaned up for general usage in the future.

Future updates:
  Recursive design that takes an n-dimensional integral and puts it fully into a sum
  Cleaner documentation and implementation
  Integration with Sympy framework
